Refactoring is a **disciplined process** of improving code quality while preserving its external functionality. It reorganizes a program's **internal structure** to make it cleaner, better-designed. and easier to work with.

### Key Characteristics:

- Performed in **small, incremental steps** to minimize risks;
- Focuses on **internal improvements**, such as reducing complexity or improving readability;
- Ensures no changes to the **observable behavior** of the software.

### Purpose

- Transform chaotic, poorly.designed code into well-structured software;
- Enhance long-term maintainability while minimizing the  change of introducing bugs.

## Why Refactor?


### Code Smells

Indications of problematic code, such as:

- **Duplicated Code:** Repetition across the program increases maintenance effort;
- **Long Methods or Loops:** Difficult to read, test, or debug;
- **Poor Cohesion:** A class or method does too many unrelated things;
- **Inconsistent Abstractions:** Interfaces or parameters are either too complex  or too shallow;
- **Excessive Dependencies:** Classes or methods are overly reliant on others.

### Design Issues

- Poorly organizer inheritance hierarchies requiring parallel changes;
- Overloaded primitive data types or unused classes;
- Classes or routines doing too little or too much.

### Poor Naming

- Variable or method names fail to describe their purpose;
- Comments are necessary to explain difficult code.

### Global Variables and Setups

- Overuse of globals or routines requiring complex setup/take down code.

### Future-Proofing

- Code contains speculative elements ("might be needed someday"), cluttering the design.

## Benefits of Refactoring

- **Improve Design:** Prevents architectural degradation by continually reorganizing and optimizing;
- **Eases Understanding:** Clean, well organized code is easier for new developer to comprehend;
- **Facilitate Bug Fixes:** By simplifying logic and improving readability, issues become easier to identify;
- **Speeds Development:** A clear codebase makes adding new features less cumbersome.

## The Refactoring Process


### Prerequisites

- Have a robust suite of **self-checking tests** to validate that functionality remains unchanged;
- Approach refactoring as a series of **small, manageable steps**, each improving one aspect of the code.

### Key Refactoring Steps

- **Identify the Problem:** Detect smells or inefficiencies in the code;
- **Apply Refactoring Techniques:** Modify the structure while preserving behavior;
- **Test:** Run existing tests to ensure the program works as before.

### Refactoring in Practive

- When adding a new feature, **refactor first** if the current code structure makes the addition difficult. This ensures cleaner integration of new functionality.

## Common Refactoring Techniques

### Extract Method:

- Identify repetitive or complex code fragments;
- Move them into a separate method with a descriptive name.

### Move Method:

- Relocate a method to the class it interacts with most, reducing unnecessary dependencies.

### Rename Variables or Methods:

- Improve clarity by renaming poorly described elements;
- Good names reduce the need for comments or explanatory documentation.

### Inline Method:

- Simplify by replacing a method call with its body if the method adds no clarity.

### Remove Temporary Variables:

- Replace temporary variables with direct queries or calculations to reduce unnecessary clutter.

### Introduce Explaining Variable:

- Simplify complicated expressions by storing results in a temporary variable with a clear name.

### Substitute Algorithm:

- Replace an existing algorithm with one that is simpler or more efficient.

### Extract Class:

- Divide a class performing too many functions into smaller, more focused classes.

### Eliminate Redundancy:

- Consolidate duplicated code across methods or classes into reusable components.

## Code Smells and Anti-Patterns

Refactoring helps eliminate "bad come smells", categorized as follows:

### Bloaters

- Overly large methods, classes, or parameter lists that are difficult to manage;
- Example: A method with 15 parameters when only 5 are necessary.

### Object-Oriented Abusers

- Misuse of inheritance, poorly defined interfaces, or violation of encapsulation principles.

### Change Preventers

- Dependencies that require multiple modifications across the codebase for a single change;
- Example: A bug fix in one class requires changes in 10 other locations.

### Dispensables

- Unnecessary elements, like unused variables, dead code, or redundant comments.

### Couplers

- Excessive coupling between classes or methods, making the system fragile and hard to modify.

## Refactoring and Design

### Complementary to Upfront Design

- Refactoring can enhance or replace initial design, especially in Agile practices where design evolver over time.

### Simplifies Design

- Refactoring helps refine designs without sacrificing flexibility, reducing stress during development.
