Requirements engineering is a relatively new term encompassing all activities related to identifying, negotiating, documenting,, and maintaining requirements. It is sometimes referred to as _analysis_. Key point include:

- **Scope:** It transforms informal real-world descriptions into formal system specifications;
- **Objective:** Requirements engineering aims to study the problem domain thoroughly before initiating design or implementation;
- **Focus:** It addresses real-world objectives and constraints for software systems.

The primary goals of requirements engineering are:

- To ensure all relevant requirements are identified, understood, and documented at the appropriate level of detail;
- To reach agreement on the requirements among stakeholders;
- To document requirements using defined formats and templates.

A critical aspect is maintaining a clear separation between defining what the system must do (requirements) and how it will be implemented (solutions).

## Activities in Requirements Engineering

The requirements engineering process consists of seven main activities:

- **1. Inception:**
	- Initiates the process based on business needs or dissatisfaction with the current situation;
	- The aim is to define the client's vision and evaluate whether existing solutions already meet their needs.
- **2. Elicitation:**
	- Focuses on gathering requirements from stakeholders;
	- Involves techniques such as interviews, surveys, ethnography, prototyping, and scenario analysis.
- **3. Elaboration:**
	- Organizes and analyzes elicited requirements;
	- Ensures that requirements are coherent, non-contradictory, complete and free of vagueness.
- **4. Negotiation:**
	- Addresses conflicts among stakeholders regarding the requirements;
	- Utilizes prioritization techniques to decide which requirements should be implemented first.
- **5. Documentation:**
	- Produces a reference document for development phases;
	- Documentation is categorized into user requirements (broad expectations) and system requirements (detailed specifications).
- **6. Validation:**
	- Ensures that the documented requirements match what the client desires;
	- Conducted through inspections and reviews.
- **7. Management:**
	- Deals with changes in requirements throughout the development process;
	- Identifies mechanisms to evaluate and incorporate changes without significant disruption.

## Challenges and Problems in Requirements Engineering

- **1. Difficulties in Communication:**
	- Stakeholders may struggle to articulate their needs clearly;
	- Engineers often misinterpret client requirements, leading to incorrect solutions.
- **2. Dynamic Nature of Requirements:**
	- Requirements frequently change during development;
	- For example, Microsoft projects reportedly experience a 30% change in requirements by the end of the development phase.
- **3. Use of Jargon:**
	- Technical language can create a misunderstandings between engineers and stakeholders.
- **4. Complexity of the Task:**
	- Requirement engineering is one of the most challenging aspects of software development;
	- No single elicitation technique suffices for all systems, requiring engineers to adapt based on project context and complexity.

To address challenges, techniques like user observation, stakeholder engagement, and flexible change management are recommended, A clear understanding of the problem domain is essential to avoid misaligned solutions.
