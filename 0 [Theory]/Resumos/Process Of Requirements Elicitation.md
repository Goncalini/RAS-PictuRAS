Requirements elicitation, also known as requirements discovery or acquisition, is essential for understanding the needs and expectations of stakeholders regarding a system. This process involves:

- **1. Studying the Domain:** Gaining knowledge about the environment in which the system will operate;

- **2. Identifying Sources:** Determining the individuals or artifacts that provide valuable insights;

- **3. Consulting Stakeholders:** Engaging stakeholders to gather their input;

- **4. Selecting Techniques:** Choosing appropriate methods to elicit requirements;

- **5. Eliciting Requirements:** Capturing the information necessary for the system  development.

Elicitation activities extend throughout the system's life-cycle, ensuring flexibility and adaptability to changes.

## Identification of Stakeholders

Stakeholders are a primary source of information during elicitation. They include individuals or entities with legitimate interests in the system, either directly or indirectly affected by its development. Key points include:

- **1. Roles:**
	- Stakeholders can occupy multiple roles (e.g., company director, accounting);
	- Role should be identifies and documented to clarify responsibilities.
- **2. Stakeholders Types:**
	- **Users:** Direct operators of the system (e.g., drivers, passengers);
	- **Clients:** Entities commissioning and paying for the system development, often distinct from users;
	- **Customers:** End consumers who purchase or use the product;
	- **Market Segments:** Groups of customers with shared needs or behaviors;
	- **Negative Stakeholders:** Individuals opposing the system's development, potentially due to personal or political reasons.
- **3. Identifying Methods:**
	- Consulting clients;
	- Analyzing organizational charts;
	- Examining similar products;
	- Reviewing the system's context.

Understanding stakeholder diversity, such as disabilities or literacy levels, is crucial for creating inclusive systems.

## Techniques for Requirements Elicitation

We can categorize them into three, _individual techniques_, _group techniques_, and _artifact-based techniques:_

### Individual Techniques

- **1. Interviews:**
	- Structured or semi-structured interactions with stakeholders to gather detailed insights;
	- Essential steps include identifying interviewees, preparing questions, conducting the interview, and summarizing findings.
- **2. Surveys:**
	- Collecting data from a broader audience using questionnaires;
	- Effective when well.designed, with clear and concise questions.
- **3. Introspection:**
	- Analysts rely on their understanding of the domain to infer requirements;
	- Useful as a starting point but should not replace direct stakeholder input.

### Group Techniques

- **1. Brainstorming:**
	- Generating a wide range of ideas without judgement;
	- Effective for exploring possibilities and consolidating them into actionable insights.

### Artifact-Based Techniques

- **1. Domain Analysis:**
	- Reviewing existing documentation and studying similar systems to extract requirements;
	- Helps build domain knowledge and identify common patterns.
- **2. Prototyping:**
	- Creating preliminary models to capture requirements iteratively;
	- Useful when stakeholders cannot articulate detailed needs initially.
- **3. Personas:**
	- Developing fictitious profiles to represent target users;
	- Personas highlights user goals, behaviors, and contexts to ensure the system aligns with their needs.
