Modeling is integral to engineering, involving abstraction, simplification, and formalization. It entails selecting appropriate concepts and abstractions to construct a model that represents a specific reality for a given purpose. Key points include:

- **Purpose:** A model simplifies reality, focusing on aspects relevant to the modeler's goals;
- **Abstraction:** Removes unnecessary details to highlight essential elements;
- **Utility:** Models are cost-effective alternatives to real-world objects or processes for analysis and reasoning.

Characteristics of models include:
- **Abstraction:** Reduced representation of the system;
- **Understandability:** Simplified viewpoints to facilitate comprehension;
- **Accuracy:** Faithful representation of key properties;
- **Reasoning:** Enables analysis and predictions about the system;
- **Cost-Effectiveness:** Cheaper to create and analyze than the actual system.

## Characteristics of Models

Models are classified along three dimensions:

- **1. Form:**
	- **Physical Models:** Material representation, often scaled versions of real-world objects;
	- **Symbolic Models:** Logical or mathematical abstractions, such as UML diagrams or equations.
- **2. Representativeness:**
	- **Descriptive Models:** Describe existing systems or phenomena (e.g., weather models);
	- **Prescriptive Models:** Define how systems should behave or be constructed, commonly used in forward engineering.
- **3. Perspective:**
	- **Structural Models:** Represent the static components and architecture of a system (e.g., UML Class Diagrams);
	- **Behavioral Models:** Emphasize dynamic, functional, and temporal system aspects (e.g., state diagrams, data flow diagrams).

## Models for Requirements

Models play a critical role during the analysis phase of requirements engineering, providing a structured way to document system requirements. UML (Unified Modelling Language) is widely used in the industry, with specific diagrams suited to different modeling needs:

- **1. Domain Models:**
	- Capture the vocabulary, concepts, and scope of a system's domain;
	- Highlight common elements across related systems.
- **2. Use Case Models:**
	- Define system boundaries and functionalities available to users;
	- Consiste of actors (users or systems) and use cases (specific functionalities).
- **3. Class Models:**
	- Describe system components, their attributes, and relationships;
	- Crucial for object-oriented software development.
- **4. Sequence Models:**
	- Depict communication among objects or components;
	- Show the flow of messages and the dynamic interactions within the system.
- **5. State Models:**
	- Represent the states and transitions of system components over time;
	- Useful for modeling dynamic behaviors and temporal conditions.
- **6. Activity Models:**
	- Illustrate control flow among activities in a process;
	- Useful for business process modeling and systems with complex workflows.
